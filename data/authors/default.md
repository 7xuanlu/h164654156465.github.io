I am essentially an essentialist. I value code quality and design patterns, pursuing my career as a clean coder. Being a master student at Carnegie Mellon University, I specialize in full-stack and backend development. My past work experience have solidified my programming and teamwork skills. As a new graduate in 2022, I'm ready to contribute my passion to the next big thing!

Top skills: Java, Spring Boot, JavaScript, TypeScript, Nodejs, React, Python, Django...
